title: The events of the last ~3 weeks in Hobart City Council
---



The following is an attempt by me to retell the events of the last ~3 weeks in Hobart City Council. *I will note that all information here is public, there is nothing in here that could not be found by anyone else.*

(a note that throughout I refer to the wider membership of the council as 'council members', as in Hobart the members are able to choose between 'councillor' or 'alderman')

### The motion that started it all
On 7th of February, Councillor Louise Elliot (note that this is about Elliot and not Alderman Louise Bloomfield, another member of the Hobart City Council) posts on her Facebook her concerns that ['biological adult men are now allowed in female only change rooms and toilets and vice versa'](https://www.facebook.com/louiseelliothobart/posts/pfbid0yfM7zkjux8uXKVJQbAmnPZkW7Fdsnmjq6F8Mip5kPm2qXr94qfLyo3YLhXhPksfkl). She then proceeds to propose a motion, which text can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LXUYPU3IjQvs5Qi8iZBORleNoK9dJ50K/view?usp=sharing). I have not attempted to summarise the motion text because frankly it is too hard to do so in a manner that is not overly long (if you would like to read it I would encourage you to read the rationale of the motion as well). This motion is then condemned by [Equality Tasmania](https://www.facebook.com/EqualityTas/posts/pfbid02zBNxoGPmpYg7tYnPis7hmzg83zTuCnPGAny5chjoLpZWyRioZMQH8xNAAXCRabyDl). 

At this other members of council note their concern with the motion and other [actions of Elliot](https://www.facebook.com/SherlockZe/posts/pfbid02af8LEmtEU53mjmZHAK4DsahPVVpghhNgSEo8Hrp3LWRE1Y3YWEb6i52xzSFPgpqal). Councillor Dr Zelinda Sherlock and Councillor Ryan Posselt introduce a motion to council in response to Elliot, which can be read [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cg_y2-m5Pft_KSSbJycMTXYo35Wvb8f6/view?usp=sharing). In short the motion to rebut Elliot, makes council members have mandatory training in regards to their obligations under the *Anti-Discrimination Act 1998*, and also requests that the council CEO writes to the director of local government to investigate comments made by Elliot. These comments for which the councillors request she be investigated for can be found in the [appendix attached](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B6BzxgwQL9ziJdc6kDnCP1hrAjY9kaC0/view?usp=sharing).

Elliot did not like this appendix (or the motion), and so tweets '[@ZelSherlock here's another for your screen shot file ! ðŸ˜€]'(https://twitter.com/LouiseElliot19/status/1625980770874716163?s=20), and some more tweets along this line. 

Later on, an individual (I do not know who) also draws a cartoon of Sherlock and Posselt [as nazis](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Posselt/status/1627289467261448192?s=20). 

### The meeting and the video
At the meeting, Elliot's motion is roundly defeated 3-9, and Posselt and Sherlock's motion is passed 9-3. 

During Elliot's motion, Posselt looks rather exacerbated.  Posselt also implies later in his speech against the motion that she is 'a clown'.  (Posselt can be seen in the footage as they are assigned seating next to one another). Elliot then posts the footage of her speech to Facebook, and but an extremely prominent transphobe on twitter called Sall Grover (49 k followers on the site) becomes involved and tweets out footage from the council meeting (I am unaware of where Grover obtained the clip in question). While Posselt is not named by Grover, Elliot does tag and name him in replies to the tweet.  

This then brings in an influx of transphobes (seemingly mostly from the UK) to abuse firstly Posselt, and then other members of the council.

### The terfs

As far as I can tell, the abuse was initially directed as Posselt. It is worth noting that some of these tweets [threatened physical violence](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Posselt/status/1628357963332349953?s=20). 

Kevin Bonham noted that at one point [Posselt was getting 2.8 mentions per minute on twitter](https://twitter.com/kevinbonham/status/1628722630940569602?s=20). (I will note that while some of this was not abuse, the near majority of it was)

Posselt noted his concern around [his safety and also for mental distress to his family](https://twitter.com/Ryan_Posselt/status/1628349729880027136?s=20). Elliot continued with her attacks on Posselt after this. In general, if Elliot were to tag another twitter account, this tended to then cause other individuals to then attack said account (this is not to suggest that Elliot directed them to do so). 

This abuse was not limited to Posselt. Councillor Ben Lohberger [also received abuse](https://twitter.com/BenGlenHuon/status/1629035624606097409?s=20). Numerous other council members have also received abuse, though I am not naming these members here as these members have not bought public attention to it in a forum where i've seen it.  A number of non-councillors on twitter also began to recieve abuse.


### The alt
At one point during the above saga, I notice a tweet from Elliot which I personally considered to be hypocritical. I therefore ask Elliot a question in regards to this tweet. In response, I receive the reply below from an account I have never heard of nor interacted with.

As I read the tweet and examine the account I notice something odd, mainly that what the account has written makes no sense.  Others also noticed this tweet and we all came to the same conclusion - that this account was almost certainly the Alt account of Elliot.  After I ask this account who they are, the tweet was deleted.

What was notable about this account that was to all best evidence Elliot's Alt is that it had commented on tweets from Posselt. I read a number of these comments, though annoyingly forgot to take screenshots. After it was revealed that this account was almost certainly the alt of Elliot, the account was [deleted](https://twitter.com/Erin_Ranger_9). 


## Appendix - the Ryk Goddard interview 

This was not super relevant to the story above, which was attempting to focus on the abuse council members have been receiving and Elliot's alt, but one thing which did occur leading up to the council meeting was that Elliot appeared on Ryk Goddard's Breakfast program on ABC Radio Hobart. In the program [Elliot is given an opportunity to discuss her motion but instead chooses to attack Goddard and the wider ABC for perceived bias](https://twitter.com/BenGlenHuon/status/1625402497044205568?s=20). After Elliot has gained some note on twitter with the transphobic community, she attempts to republicise the interview, though was unable to (so far).
